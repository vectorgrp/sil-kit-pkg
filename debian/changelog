libsilkit (5.0.0-1ubuntu1) stable; urgency=medium
  * API: added new SilKit_ParticipantConfiguration_ToJson function which exports the complete parsed and validated participant configuration as a JSON string.
  * dashboard: add performance related metrics.
  * public API: removed harmful noexcept and added a missing virtual destructor.
  * dashboard: removed legacy v1.0 API.
  * build: the internal code now uses C++17
  * config: we replaced yaml-cpp with rapidyaml and rewrote the YAML/JSON parsing.

libsilkit (4.0.56-1ubuntu1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Three static methods which are part of the C++ (Hourglass) API
    implementation and passed as callbacks to the C-API, did not use the
    correct calling convention if the default calling convention wasn't
    __cdecl on Windows. This has been remedied.

  * SilKitDemoSimStepAsync did not work as intended, due to the predicate
    lambda capturing by-value instead of by-reference

  * The participant configuration TcpNoDelay now defaults to true. Please
    note, that this has performance implications. On Linux platforms this
    improves throughput, and latency in particular when used in combination
    with TcpQuickAck: true

  * The documentation now contains a page that explains the upcoming new
    versioning scheme. Experimental other-simulation-steps-completed API

libsilkit (4.0.55-1ubuntu1) stable; urgency=medium

  * SilKit_LinDataLengthUnknown in the C header Lin.h has been turned into
    a define like all the other constants in the C header files.
  * Aligned C API error return codes SilKit_ReturnCode_XXX and SIL Kit
    specific exceptions.
  * Demos: Overhauled and restructured most existing demos.
  * Demos: Added SimpleCan and Orchestration demos for basic API usage.
  * Demos: Added sample participant configuration files.
  * Registry: Block all attempts to connect with an already present
    participant name, not just the first.
  * CMake: When demos are installed into the bin directory under the
    installation prefix, their RPATH will be set such that they are able to
    find the libSilKit[d].so.
  * System Monitor: Show all participants, not just the ones that joined
    during the monitors execution.

libsilkit (4.0.54-1ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Override the labels of DataPublisher, DataSubscriber,
    RpcClient, and RpcServer instances through the participant
    configuration, extending the already possible override of the topic /
    function name.
  * Changed log messages for controller and participant creation, message
    tracing, system state tracker and time sync service
  * Revised the documentation (demos, troubleshooting, doxygen output, file
    structure)
  * Improved platform/compiler/architecture detection
  * Failure to configure and package cross-builds to QNX on Windows

libsilkit (4.0.51-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium


  * Couple the virtual time to the wall clock. An animation factor can be
    configured that describes how fast the simulation is allowed to run relative
    to the local wall clock. Accessible via a new experimental section in the
    Participant Configuration (Experimental | TimeSynchronization |
    AnimationFactor).
  * Event flow documentation for the Network Simulation API.
  * Registry (Dashboard): Automatically use bulk-endpoint if it is available
